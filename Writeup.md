# Folly vs Libstd++

## About libstd++
Libstd++ is the default C/C++ library that ships with gcc/g++. A mirror of its source code can be found here - https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/tree/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3

## Why Folly?
Folly is "a library of C++14 components designed with practicality and efficiency in mind"(1). It aims to provide performant library code that complements the standard library. String performance is a critical part of overall performance, and according to a Cppcon talk given by Nicholas Ormrod (4), 18% of CPU time facebook programs spend in the stl is spent in ```<string>```. With such widespread usage, even minor optimizations can translate to significant performance gains for programs.


## About Strings

Both gcc and folly tackle strings differently then a naive implementation would look like. A naive string implementation would something like this:

```cpp
struct naiveString{
	int size;
	int capacity;
	char* storage;
};
```
where ```storage``` is heap allocated memory.


  Both std::string and fbstring use a special optimization to save space with small strings. Older versions of gcc (gcc < 5) would have a global variable representing an empty string that all empty strings would point to, which saves space(4). Both strings take extreme lengths for optimization.
## Folly vs Libstd++ String
Both string classes implement ```std::string``` according to the standard. ```folly::fbstring``` has a few different features in its implementation compared to ```std::string```, which should theoretically give it a performance gain, if only a small one. To allocate memory, ```std::string``` uses an ```std::allocator``` to allocate heap memory on its behalf. In contrast,  ```folly::fbstring``` uses a clever three tiered storage approach (2). For a string with 23 chars or fewer, fbstring stores the string on the stack. For a string with 24 - 255 chars, folly stores on the heap, and "copies eagerly". For strings with greater than 255 chars, folly will use lazy copying (folly will use copy on write to defer memory allocation). Folly promises drop in compatability with ```std::string``` 

### Find()
Folly promises significantly better performance for ```find()``` (documentation suggests 30x speed improvements)

## Folly specific
Folly readily converts between ```std::string``` and ```folly::fbstring```.

## Testing methodology
All tests were run on an i5 9300H running at 2.4 GHz. Tests were compiled in release mode using Clang 12. libstd++ version was 2.27.

## Results
The results were almost a wash. On a single string allocation, std::string beat folly::fbstring. However, with a std::vector with 100k elements ```reserve()```'d, folly beat libc string at small string (less than 23 chars).  

### Default Construction
An array T[] is required to default construct all members, so by making an array of strings it is possible to benchmark the string's default constructor performance. Folly sees a win of default constructing an array of 100000 elements.


### Small, Medium, and large strings
All 3 tests were done with a ```std::vector``` reserved to size 100000.

* Folly beat fbstring at all sizes
* Folly demonstrated the largest win with long string, beating libstd++ by a wide margin (0.38 seconds)!

### Small, medium, and larg find()


## Conclusion
In conclusion, fbstring beats libstd string with a large number of allocations. However, that doesn't mean that c++ programmers should universally dump libc in exchange for folly or other stl alternatives. The performance gains were extremely minor and measurable improvements would likely only be seen in extremely large projects like in facebook. In those same large projects, the cost of adding another dependency, switching to folly, and testing to make sure the switch to ```folly::string``` didn't break anything would likely outweigh the miniscule gains in string performance.
